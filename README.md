# phrases

The goal of phrases is to list all phrasal verbs in [English Club website](https://www.englishclub.com/ref/Phrasal_Verbs/).

I believe it would be a good learning resource to improve English within R.

## Example

Install with `devtools::install_github("sumandoc/phrases")`.

To see all the phrasal verbs execute:
``` r
library(phrases)
View(phrases)
```
